# To do
 - Add bifurcation codes for other load conditions
 - Add bifurcation codes with model-specific simplifications (this will hopefully speed up the calculation of the bifurcation matrix slightly)
 - Add other models
 - Potentially add other continua (second gradient, full first-order micromorphic) and finite strain cases.
